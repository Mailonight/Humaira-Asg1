ID Assignment 1
I created a motorcycle rental website for a brand name MoreMoto. They needed a stronger reach to a broader audience islandwide, so a website is needed for them to achieve this goal. In their website, they would allow easy access to many deals such as student monthly plan and easy access to contact to the company.

Design Process
Who this website is for: 
1. People who are interested in riding a motorcycle but at a cheaper cost
2. People who are avid users of motorcycle and wants an easy access to a motorcycle company for emergency purposes or normal purposes.
3. Students that have motorcycle license but can't afford the high expenses of owning a motorcycle full-time.

What is it that the audience would want to achieve:

Most students that are motorcycle users would want a motorcycle rental service that is cheap hence, my company would provide a cheaper price for such audience. On top of that, their prices are included with helmets costs and any breakdowns that might occur. Hence, the customers could rely strongly on us.
On the other hand, we are also aware, that whenever motorcyclists faced an unforseeable emergency, they might not know who to contact, hence we would provide services such towing for them. 
Moreover, there are customers that are seeking a place or platform to sell their motorcycle, they could do so with my company on my website.

How my project is the best way to help them achieve these things:

My project, which is to provide a website platform for the targeted audiences would successfully achieve their desired motive through this website because it allows easy access to every contact details, such as whatsapp and details explaining services. Furthermore, this website allows users to browse through their desired motorcycles to rent, which becomes easier rather than coming in-store and browsing on-site. With the convenience provided, our company, MoreMoto would entice more customers islandwide as well as gaining significant sales revenue.

User Stories:

As a user type, I want to perform an action: 

So that I can achieve (Goal):

Features:

Existing features:

Feature 1- Whatsapp button
Allows users to achieve an interactive communication with the company. By clicking on the button, users will be directed to whatsapp web and hence they can begin chat with the company. This is an important feature especially for those that are willing to contact the company immediately to clear their doubts as soon as possible.
